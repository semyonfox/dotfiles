# Cloudflare Platform Skill

Consolidated skill for building on the Cloudflare platform. Use decision trees below to find the right product, then load detailed references.

Your knowledge of Cloudflare APIs, types, limits, and pricing may be outdated. **Prefer retrieval over pre-training** — the references in this skill are starting points, not source of truth.

## Retrieval Sources

Fetch the **latest** information before citing specific numbers, API signatures, or configuration options. Do not rely on baked-in knowledge or these reference files alone.

### Local migration references

- `references/zone-account-migration.md` — practical checklist and pitfalls for moving a domain between Cloudflare accounts, including token permissions, registrar nameserver propagation checks, and Cloudflare Tunnel DNS-route gotchas.
- `references/zone-account-migration-r2-queues-email.md` — follow-up checklist for account moves that also involve R2 object migration, Queues HTTP pull consumers, Email Routing, exact-key verification, and runtime env cutover.
- `references/r2-queues-email-account-migration.md` — app-resource migration notes for R2, Queues, Wrangler auth pitfalls, and Email Routing MX cutover after a zone/account move.
- `references/account-migration-r2-queues-email.md` — account-migration pitfalls for R2 buckets, Queues, Email Routing, Wrangler `--remote`, dashboard R2 enablement, and DNS/MX cutover verification.

| Source | How to retrieve | Use for |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Cloudflare docs | `cloudflare-docs` search tool or `https://developers.cloudflare.com/` | Limits, pricing, API reference, compatibility dates/flags |
| Workers types | `npm pack @cloudflare/workers-types` or check `node_modules` | Type signatures, binding shapes, handler types |
| Wrangler config schema | `node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json` | Config fields, binding shapes, allowed values |
| Product changelogs | `https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/` | Recent changes to limits, features, deprecations |

When a reference file and the docs disagree, **trust the docs**. This is especially important for: numeric limits, pricing tiers, type signatures, and configuration options.

## Quick Decision Trees

### "I need feature flags"

```
Need feature flags?
└─ Feature toggles, targeting rules, percentage rollouts → flagship/
   ├─ Evaluate in Workers → Flagship binding (env.FLAGS)
   ├─ Evaluate in Node.js / browser → OpenFeature SDK (@cloudflare/flagship)
   └─ Manage flags via API → Flagship REST API
```

### "I need to run code"

```
Need to run code?
├─ Serverless functions at the edge → workers/
├─ Full-stack web app with Git deploys → pages/
├─ Stateful coordination/real-time → durable-objects/
├─ Long-running multi-step jobs → workflows/
├─ Run containers → containers/
├─ Multi-tenant (customers deploy code) → workers-for-platforms/
├─ Scheduled tasks (cron) → cron-triggers/
├─ Lightweight edge logic (modify HTTP) → snippets/
├─ Process Worker execution events (logs/observability) → tail-workers/
└─ Optimize latency to backend infrastructure → smart-placement/
```

### "I need to store data"

```
Need storage?
├─ Key-value (config, sessions, cache) → kv/
├─ Relational SQL → d1/ (SQLite) or hyperdrive/ (existing Postgres/MySQL)
├─ Object/file storage (S3-compatible) → r2/
├─ Versioned file trees (repos, build outputs, checkpoints) → artifacts/
├─ Message queue (async processing) → queues/
├─ Vector embeddings (AI/semantic search) → vectorize/
├─ Strongly-consistent per-entity state → durable-objects/ (DO storage)
├─ Secrets management → secrets-store/
├─ Streaming ETL to R2 → pipelines/
└─ Persistent cache (long-term retention) → cache-reserve/
```

### "I need AI/ML"

```
Need AI?
├─ Run inference (LLMs, embeddings, images) → workers-ai/
├─ Vector database for RAG/search → vectorize/
├─ Build stateful AI agents → agents-sdk/
├─ Gateway for any AI provider (caching, routing) → ai-gateway/
└─ AI-powered search widget → ai-search/
```

### "I need networking/connectivity"

```
Need networking?
├─ Expose local service to internet → tunnel/
├─ Move a domain between Cloudflare accounts with Tunnel cutover → references/zone-account-migration-tunnel-cutover.md
├─ TCP/UDP proxy (non-HTTP) → spectrum/
├─ WebRTC TURN server → turn/
├─ Private network connectivity → network-interconnect/
├─ Optimize routing → argo-smart-routing/
├─ Optimize latency to backend (not user) → smart-placement/
└─ Real-time video/audio → realtimekit/ or realtime-sfu/
```

### "I need to move a domain between Cloudflare accounts"

Use `references/zone-account-migration.md` for the CLI/API workflow: inspect current NS/registrar, export DNS records from the source zone, create the destination zone with a target-account user API token, copy portable DNS records, then update registrar nameservers. Common pitfall: a `cloudflared` tunnel token or zone-scoped token may verify successfully but still fail zone creation with `com.cloudflare.api.account.zone.create`; the target-account token needs `Zone → Zone → Edit` plus `Zone → DNS → Edit` over **All zones**.

If the app also uses account-scoped products (R2, Queues, Email Routing), immediately load `references/zone-account-migration-r2-queues-email.md`. DNS moving cleanly does **not** migrate R2 buckets, S3 credentials, queue IDs, HTTP pull consumers, or runtime env files.

For migrations that also involve R2, Queues, and Email Routing, see `references/oghmanotes-account-migration-lessons-2026-07-01.md`: `wrangler r2 object get/put` needs `--remote`, destination R2 may need dashboard enablement first, Email Routing cannot be enabled until non-Cloudflare MX records are removed, and mail records should stay DNS-only.

If the app also uses R2, Queues, or Email Routing, also use `references/r2-queues-email-account-migration.md`. Move app resources separately from the DNS zone: back up R2 with account-stable S3 credentials before switching Wrangler auth, recreate queues and HTTP consumers in the target account, and keep old runtime env active until destination resources are verified.

If app resources are involved, also use `references/account-migration-r2-queues-email.md`: R2 buckets and Queues are account-scoped and do not move with the zone; Email Routing catch-all rules can exist while routing is still disabled; and Wrangler R2 object operations need `--remote` for remote storage.

### "I need security"

```
Need security?
├─ Web Application Firewall → waf/
├─ DDoS protection → ddos/
├─ Bot detection/management → bot-management/
├─ API protection → api-shield/
├─ CAPTCHA alternative → turnstile/
└─ Credential leak detection → waf/ (managed ruleset)
```

### "I need media/content"

```
Need media?
├─ Image optimization/transformation → images/
├─ Video streaming/encoding → stream/
├─ Browser automation/screenshots → browser-rendering/
└─ Third-party script management → zaraz/
```

### "I need analytics/metrics data"

```
Need analytics?
├─ Query across all Cloudflare products (HTTP, Workers, DNS, etc.) → graphql-api/
├─ Custom high-cardinality metrics from Workers → analytics-engine/
├─ Client-side (RUM) performance data → web-analytics/
├─ Workers Logs and real-time debugging → observability/
└─ Raw logs (Logpush to external tools) → Cloudflare docs
```

### "I need infrastructure-as-code"

```
Need IaC? → pulumi/ (Pulumi), terraform/ (Terraform), or api/ (REST API)
```
