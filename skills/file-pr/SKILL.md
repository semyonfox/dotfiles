# File PR

Before filing, check whether a PR for this branch already exists. Review the diff locally against `origin/main` to confirm its contents match the goal.

PR titles usually become commit messages, so follow the repository's title conventions.
Look at recently merged PRs and Git history for examples.
Prefer a concise, human-readable title that explains why the change matters:

Bad:

> perf(server): negotiate permessage-deflate on the WebSocket

Good:

> perf(server): cut WebSocket frame size by 70%+ with gzipping

Open the description with a simple explanation of the problem based on the user's original prompt, then briefly explain the solution. Do not lead with an implementation inventory:

Bad:

> Removed implicit workspace carry-over from every 'new thread' entry point (cmd+n / cmd+shift+o, sidebar v1/v2 buttons, command palatte). New threads inherit only the project from context; branch, work tree, and env mode always come from the configured defaults. Deleted buildContextualThreadOptions, startNewThreadInProjectFromContext, and the V1 sidebar is seed-context machinery.

Good:

> My 'new worktree' default was ignored when starting new threads on existing worktrees. Super unintuitive. Now your preferences always apply.

Open a real PR, rather than a draft, so review bots run. If the user asks to babysit or monitor it, use the `babysit-pr`.
